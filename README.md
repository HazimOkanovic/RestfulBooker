# RestfulBooker RestSharp Testing

This is the project that I did for practising API automation testing with C#, RestSharp, and NUnit. 

I have used a documentation on the official website of RestfulBooker. 

There are 21 tests in total. Tests are dividied into sections related to the used endpoint. 

All the packages are downloaded from Nuget and they are as follows:

  - RestSharp.108.0.3.
  - NUnit.3.13.3.
  - NUnit3TestAdapter.4.3.1
  - System.Net.Http.4.3.4
  - System.IO.4.3.0
  - Newtonsoft.Json.13.0.2.
  - System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.7.0.0.
